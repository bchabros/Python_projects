Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, help me
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine, has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
[Verse 2]
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been

Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye
[Instrumental Outro]86EmbedCreeping Death Lyrics[Verse 1]

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?
[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Leave me be

Just leave me alone

Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again30Embed...And Justice for All Lyrics[Verse 1]
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price

Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

I can't believe, I can't believe the price

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower

Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession

Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry

Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? Yeah

Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 2]
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again

Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
[Refrain]
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

[Verse 2]
Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

[Refrain]
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Ripping wounds in me that never heal

Whiplash!

[Verse 3]
Here on stage, the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fucking loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, cause this is what we choose

[Chorus]
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

[Instrumental Break]
Here we go!
[Guitar Solo]
Whiplash!

[Verse 4]
The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

[Chorus]
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa14EmbedTurn the Page Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
[Verse 2]
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Verse 3]
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
[Outro]
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah, there I go, yeah
There I go, yeah, here I go
There I go, there I go
And I'm gone13EmbedThe Unforgiven III Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on
[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

[Verse 2]
These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground, like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with the ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
[Bridge]
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?24EmbedAtlas, Rise! Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bitterness and burden
Curses thrust on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the masses, blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me
[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

[Verse 2]
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me
[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain

Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me
[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!8EmbedFuel Lyrics[Intro]

Give me that which I desire, ooh!

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone, I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say

You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die

When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

The day that never comes, ah
When you stand up and feel the warmth

As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains

Do you see what I see? Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

[Verse 2]
Do you fear what I fear? Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Do you know what I know? Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want? Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

[Outro]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say10EmbedThe Thing That Should Not Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity

He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell15EmbedHardwired Lyrics[Verse 1]

Hardwired to self-destruct

Once upon a planet burning, once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning all in vain

Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til I'm clean

[Chorus 4]
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps

Until it sleeps, until it sleeps
Until it sleeps, until it sleeps6EmbedLeper Messiah Lyrics[Intro: Lars Ulrich]

Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate

Deceiving thoughts destroy within

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart's owned to Mother
But I must find my way

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still (be still)
[Verse 2]
"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

[Bridge]
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
[Verse 3]
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So, let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave

[Verse 1]
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard, and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Verse 2]
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood, and we make sure
Life isn't for you, and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name, and you shall fall

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Bridge]
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
(Damage Incorporated)
Go
[Guitar Solo]

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc., you see
Step a little closer, if you please

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here

Find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witch-hunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying commonplace
Unending paper chase
Unending
[Pre-Chorus]
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

Its teeth and talons through

Silently

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized

The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none

Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending

Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd, cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna

[Chorus]
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song

Dust to dust
Fade to black

Mama, they try and break me

[Verse 1]
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

[Link]
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?
[Refrain]
Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

[Verse 2]
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

[Bridge]
Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

[Chorus]
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

[Bridge 2]
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?
[Chorus]
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

[Chorus]
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own to live my own way
[Verse 2]
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

[Chorus]
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee ohh

[Verse 1]
Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
[Chorus]
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

[Verse 2]
Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear, they pull me under

[Chorus]
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

[Chorus]
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

[Chorus]
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery
[Verse 2]
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend, before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

[Chorus]
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders

There's much more to life than what you see

All ends in tears
Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed

Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light

Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside
Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn away

Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection
Too dark to sleep
Can't slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Come won't you stay

[Outro]
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye13EmbedMotorbreath Lyrics[Verse 1]
Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it, you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

The more I bless, the more I bleed for you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah

No more, the crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?
Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much, you believe yourself
Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou

Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself

Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you

Burn your kingdom to the ground

Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you

Desperate hands that lose control
Have no mercy on your soul

Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in

Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes just to have them closed once again

As it takes me down, and down, and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts

[Verse 1]
Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

[Pre-Chorus]
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life

[Verse 2]
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission until the war would start again
Start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

[Chorus]
Almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life

And he is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor (How much longer?)
And he is howling with pain, crawling up the walls (How much longer?)

And he is weak with evil and broken by the world (How much longer?)
And he is shouting your name and asking for more (How much longer?)
There is a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer?)

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble

[Chorus]
But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

[Verse 2]
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time, the needles turn from shine to rust

[Chorus]
But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
[Ad-lib]
Jab it
Here come the pins

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse. a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again

[Chorus]
So tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no1EmbedThe Struggle Within Lyrics[Verse 1]
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
S-s-s-s-so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell-ow

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
But do I start writing all this down?

Take the chill off of my life

Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madmans face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand has become a crust
Most of you have gone away (yeah, gone away)

[Verse 2]
Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you will soon be married
And you will want to know where winds come from
Well it is never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Verse 3]
Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 4]
Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Yes the light that never
Never warms, never warms, never warms

[Verse 5]
The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me
Hey, hey, hey, hey

These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

Followed you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind

Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

[Chorus 2]
Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?

Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones, they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Violate, annihilate
Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate

Destiny, inhale the fire

Into the grips

Never, never, never want it anymore
Got to get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
And she is playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me
Gotta fucking get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice
They are going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you knowEmbedMy World Lyrics[Verse 1]

"Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon!"
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it

Dancing devils in angels way

The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

One, two, three, four, one, two

[Verse 1]
All roads, they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver
[Refrain]
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a .45
Suck on the barrel, suck on the barrel
Suck 'til it's gone dry
For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

[Verse 2]
Redemption purify
Will nothing satisfy?
The scars just multiply
In the shine of the midnight revolver
Twisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
And the shine of the midnight revolver
'Cause you lied

[Chorus]
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leaving you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

[Verse 3]
Caressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver
Eternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God, now I see mine
In the shine of the midnight revolver
[Pre-Chorus]
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a .45
Suck on the barrel, suck on the barrel
Suck, suck 'til it's dry
For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
Down in misery
Down in misery

[Chorus]
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leaving you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

[Verse 4]
Oh yeah, all roads, they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver
[Pre-Chorus]
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a .45
Suck on the barrel, suck on the barrel
Suck, suck 'til it's dry
Do all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver?
'Cause you lied
Yes, you lied

[Chorus]
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leaving you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my headEmbedSabbra Cadabra Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never going to leave her, never going away

[Chorus]
Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright, alright
Someone to need me, love me every single night, yeah

Someone to live for, I'll love her 'til the end of time
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

[Bridge]
I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times, I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images, the unborn child never was conceived
You got to believe me, hey, I'm talking to you
Well, I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand when it's time to die
I don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on

[Verse 2]
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we are making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time, ah

[Chorus]
Someone to live for, I'll love her 'til the end of time
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine2EmbedFree Speech for the Dumb Lyrics[Verse]

Chained to the wheel until I am dead

Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be

I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, but still I stand

That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all

And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake this gates of hell again
Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow

Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight

Mama, they try and break me

A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day

Still they try and break me, yeah

But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

But the fist I've made
For years won't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel, ah

That never last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
Can't you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of those flames
Can't you feel your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

That never last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
Can't you hear your babies crying now?

Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face

Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again

Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay

Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay

Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right
Yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill
Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Ooh, time marches on
I want it
(For whom the bell tolls)
Absolutely

Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Luck (luck, luck)

Out (out, out)

Crawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is teared, can't read the signs
Boulevard is rusted, hard to turn
On the path of destruction, feel it burn

Feel safe
In the danger
Feel good
In the bad
Got the burning
Got the speed
Lose your turn
You crash and burn
You walk away

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong

You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
[Chorus 1]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit off from me

[Chorus 1]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me
Please, God, wake me

[Chorus 2]
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, help me

Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Look my friends to the golden sign
Lonely folks giving me the eye
Sacrifice with the golden rod
The virgin queen to the newfound god
The offering to the deity
The only thing that their minds will see

They see it right
They see it well
But they think he'll save them from their hell

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
Well just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold

Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!EmbedBrothers in Arms LyricsThese mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms
Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
Through the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There are many different worlds
So many different suns
But we all have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man's got to die
But it's written in the starlight
And in the line on your palm
We're all fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
Yea, we're all fools
We're all fools
We're all fools
Oh, such fools
We're all fools
To make war
On our brothers (x3)
We're all foolsEmbedOf Wolf and Man (Live With the SFSO) Lyrics[Intro]

Taking of fallen lamb
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep
[Chorus]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
(Back to the meaning) of life

[Verse 2]
Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air, cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

[Chorus]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean, baby
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
(Back to the meaning) of life

[Guitar Solo]
[Break]
Got any wolves out there?
Woo
I feel a change
Back to a better day
(Shapeshift)
Hair stands on the back of my neck
(Move swift)
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

[Outro]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
(Back to the meaning)
Of wolf and man
Ooh yeahEmbedWherever I May Roam (Live with the SFSO) Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And the dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
[Chorus 1]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
Redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah

[Verse 2]
The Earth become my throne
And the Earth become my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I have grown
By myself but not alone
(I ask no one)
And my ties are severed clean, baby
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

[Chorus 2]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
I do my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
[Chorus 3]
But I'll take my time anywhere
Hey, I'm free to speak my mind
I'll do my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, oh yeah

[Guitar Solo]
C'mon, baby

[Chorus 4]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
I redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lies, but still I roam, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Wherever I may roam
Ooh, wherever I may roam, yeah
Ooh, wherever I may roam
Ooh, yeah, wherever I may wander
Wherever I may roam
YeahEmbedParanoid Lyrics[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frownin'
All the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothin' seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!
[Verse 2]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Make a joke an' I will sigh an' you will laugh
An' I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel an' love, to me
Is so unreal
An' so, as you hear these words tellin' you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too lateEmbedFuel (Live with the SFSO) Lyrics[Intro]
Give me fuel
Give me fire
Give me that which I desire

One Last CaressEmbedSome Kind of Monster - Film Transcript LyricsSo, what we're gonna do is,

we're gonna play back







some of the band's new songs.






There'll be no cameras allowed

in there.







There'll be no video,

no bags in there.






You can only walk in

with paper and a pencil.







- We're ready.

- Are there any questions?







You want a single?






Camera over here.







Was there ever a moment you

thought about stopping with Metallica







or the whole band was falling apart?







Was it a kind of a power struggle

between you and him?







How did you manage

to solve this crisis?







Where in God's name are you

getting this aggression from







on this new album?

Where's it coming from?







Why did it take so long to release

an album with the new songs?







After    years,

is it possible to retain the fire







that, you know, you guys once had

at the beginning?







Do you think the young generation of

metal fans will accept the new album?







Eighty-five million records,    years.







I think it's    albums

and various official releases.







One word.







Oh, my God.







One word to span our career?







We are scanning the scene

In the city tonight







We're looking for you

To start up a fight







There is an evil feeling in our brains







But it's nothing new

You know it drives us insane







Running, on our way

Hiding, you will pay







Dying,      deaths







Running, on our way

Hiding, you will pay







Dying,      deaths







Searching







Seek and destroy







Searching







Seek and destroy







Thank you!







After    years of headbanging,

Metallica bassist Jason Newsted







has quit the band, citing:







"Private and personal reasons

and the physical damage that I've done







to myself over the years

while playing the music I love."







Metallica's management had no

comment when asked by MTV News







if there's a replacement

waiting in the wings.







But the band is still scheduled to begin

recording a new album this spring.







That's the news for now.

Stay tuned for more news.







I mean, I think everybody understands

the concept of trusting instincts.







That's getting to a place where

you don't let egos and let stuff







get in the way of artistic expression.

You know?







I mean, do you wanna say more?

I think everybody understands...







I met Metallica through

Q Prime Management,







after having seen me work

with another band of theirs,







when they called

and said that Metallica,







with Jason announcing

that he was exiting the group,







needed to take a look

at itself and say:







"Well, what's going on here? We've lost

touch with our personal relationships,"







and face some of the issues that I think

Q Prime felt that they were headed for.







You know, we haven't really worked

together for almost nine months.







When we were talking a couple

of days ago about whether--







You know, if we wanted

to do this film or not,







I was wondering if having these

guys in here would affect that.







Because I'm just--

There's an intimacy that you get







when it's just a few people

in the room,







and I'm just wondering

if that's gonna get lost,







if we're gonna go back

to sort of, like,







battling each other and trying

to be, like, all strong and--







What intimacy?

What the fuck are you talking about?







I think, to me, it's not gonna

be a matter of whether







the cameras are in play,







but whether or not you guys

are free enough







to risk being seen by other people.







We're here in the Presidio

in San Francisco,







and this is gonna be the location

where Metallica







is gonna start recording

their next album.







We decided that we didn't wanna

go back into a studio again







and do kind of, like, the same thing

we had done before.







We had to kind of change things up.







And this is one of the things

that we talked about,







was to go into a space

that's not a studio,







bring in kind of, like, a portable studio

or a makeshift studio,







and basically make

the situation uncomfortable.







You know, don't buy new furniture,

don't paint the walls.







Don't do anything.

Just keep it Spartan, keep it crude.







They're such a success

that you can get comfortable.







I don't think they wanna be

comfortable.







There's definitely a vibe in here.







They got a lot of attitude,

and I think they want it







to come out on this next album.







How did you approach

this record differently?







Did you talk about things, did you

have ideas, keywords, things like that,







that you wanted to put across

before you started







putting the whole thing together?







Well, ego was a big one.

Coming in here







and not bringing a riff,

not bringing a song,







not bringing a title. Nothing.







Me and James did not meet

somewhere else







and come in here with material,

with songs, with music.







This time we all got in a room

and just started playing.







And that's how we wrote songs.







The idea is it should

sound like a band getting together







in a garage for the first time.







Only the band's Metallica.







I really like going fast.







Just go off and meditate

in the wind, you know.







As corny as it sounds, it works,

and it feels good.







It's a good way to just let the weight

of the world off every once in a while.







It is-- It is kind of strange being,

you know,







like, a famous guy. You know.







This is-- This is part of me

that's trying to be unfamous, I guess.







But it's also

go-against-the-rules attitude.







You know, is this a big pose?

I mean, yes, this is a pose.







I mean, am I driving down the street

to not get noticed in this thing?







I mean, "rebellious" is kind of

what this says, I would say.







- Have you got a plug-in here?

- Wait.







So, what exactly are you doing?







Well, you'll just hold it

above the pickups.







Oh, okay. I got you.







Yeah!







Give me fuel, give me fire

Give me that which I desire







I got some bad news.

Gonna have to--







Change the lyrics?







I like this thing, Bob.







- What?

- I like this thing.







I used to kid myself that art was

my great escape away from music.







And I think I've become

increasingly aware







that my interest in art, music

and Metallica







is not separate from anything.







You know, where does he feel

that there's enough







of that kind of gold thing?







How come there isn't

another    strokes







up in that black area up there,

where it's kind of bare?







Where are the starting points

and the end points,







if you know what I mean?

When's a song done?







What the fuck does

that mean, anyway? Done.







When's a record done?







You know, where does a record start?

Where does it end?







Where does the process start?

Where does the process end?







All that type of stuff.

Do you know what I mean?







- Daddy!

- It's really interesting.







Yes, sweetie.







I don't feel anything great there.







I don't think

it's that great of a riff either.







- How do you hear the riff then?

- I like that:







And then:







Yeah.







In nine days, it'll be

my two-year anniversary of surfing.







It's taken the place of a lot

of bad things in my life.







So I basically stopped doing

the drugs that I was doing







and cut way back on my drinking.







You can't surf

when you're hung-over.







You can't surf if you've been up

all night. Well, at least I can't.







There's a sort of individualism,

also, about surfing that I like.







I mean, when it's your moment, man,

that's your moment and yours alone.







And no one can help you.







For all intents and purposes, we go

into this record completely equal.







Everybody contributing







just as much on the lyric front

as James contributing







with drum parts and...







As soon as you started talking

about that, I just like...







Yeah. Yeah. You flash back now.







Well...







You wanna hear it with vocals?







Go sing it.







You guys had some rules

about that before.







Quite frankly, I don't give a fuck.

I'm tired of arguing.







You couldn't talk about his lyrics,







therefore, he couldn't talk about

your drumming.







- Right.

- Do you know what I mean?







And you and him did the solos,







so you weren't allowed to comment

on the solos.







Do you know what I mean?

There was, like, rules.







Are you telling me that

those boundaries are gone now?







In the past, what we did was







started with a bunch of ideas existing

on tape from everybody.







Then me and James would sit down

and turn those ideas into songs.







And then we would tell the rest

of the band what to play







and when to play

and how to play it.







There was never any,

just, other ways of doing it.







You know, it's a whole new thing

for me.







You know, writing in front

of everybody,







because I've always just gone

into my own head







and wrote stuff down,

instead of taking things from outside







and putting them down.







What I was thinking is, is like--

"These are the hands that--"







"This is the face that--"

So it's, like--







Building a Frankenstein

or something?







- Yeah. Pretty much.

- Building what?







- "This is the top of my head that's flat."

- A Frankenstein.







"These are my bolts..."







We're on the same

stream of consciousness here.







We're just all working

on the same creative wavelength.







And it's inspiring to me.







Now I can further express myself

with these lyrics







now that, you know, James has

opened that door for Lars and I.







- This is "clay," right?

- Yeah.







- Not "clam."

- Clay.







"These hands finger the clam."







These are the eyes

That can't see through me







This is the tongue

That speaks on the inside







Make sure you really, like,

spit "can't see me."







These are the eyes

That can't see me!







These are the eyes

That can't see me







These are the hands

That drop your trust







- "This is the--"

- Yeah.







This is the eye--

Yeah.







This is the eye

That can't see me







This is the hand

That drops your trust







These are the boots

That kick you around







This is the voice of silence no more







- What is this about?

- Well, I mean, I said Frankenstein.







It's not that far off,

talking about pieces of things.







So, I mean, some kind of monster.







Some kind of monster?







- You know?

- Some kind of monster.







- It is-- It is good.

- You know what I mean?







I like that.







Some kind of monster







Some kind of monster







The monster lives







"We come now to create

our album of life.







Throughout our individual

and collective journeys,







sometimes through pain and conflict,







we've discovered the true meaning

of family.







As we accomplish ultimate

togetherness,







we become healers of ourselves







and the countless who embrace us

and our message.







We have learned,

and we understand.







Now we must share."







- So that's just--

- A mission statement.







- A what statement?

- Mission statement.







- Mission?

- Yeah, mission.







- It's like-- You know, it sets a goal,

- Right.







so you just can, like, just always be

reminded of, you know--







You know, what the ultimate goal is.







All right.







It's my world, you can't have it

It's my world, you can't have it







It's my world, you can't have it







It's my world, my world

You can't have it







Sucker!







Excellent.







Come on, little man. Let's go.







Skylar, do you want your purse?







- Daddy.

- I'll come. I'll come.







Come, Daddy. Come, Daddy.







I don't know how you guys feel, but

it's really awesome what we're doing.







The four of us can just go

in a fucking room







and roll that kind of shit

out of our sleeves.







Pull it out of thin air, man.







It's so exciting, because

that has just never happened before.







I couldn't get to sleep last night,

because I was still wired from it all.







How do you feel? You don't

seem really psyched about it.







What the hell.







- How's it going? Good to see you.

- Yeah, thank you.







- How many bears did you kill?

- Two.







Russia's fucked up.

You know, it was like,







you put a bottle of water here

on the table.







That was it,

a bottle of vodka sitting there.







- Did you drink vodka?

- Hell, yeah.







- You did?

- What else is there to drink?







As soon as you got there,

it was like, "Na zdoroviya!"







Na zdoroviya!







That's a pretty big bear.







- Is bear edible?

- They were no good to eat.







That freaked me out when

they didn't take any meat.







You know, they have been hibernating

for three months,







so they haven't pissed or shit

or nothing.







- Oh, so they're toxic?

- Yeah.







Third day, I killed my bear,







and I was just in camp

for the rest of the time.







I was like, "Oh, my God."







- Worked on lyrics?

- Yeah. I actually did.







That was a lot of time, man.







A lot of time.







I worked on lyrics in Siberia.







How to drink vodka

and work on lyrics.







Temptation

Wreck my head







Temptation

Make you dead







Temptation

Sucks my soul







Temptation

Fill no hole







Temptation







Fuck you up

Temptation







No, no, no, no

I can't say no







Can't say no

No







No

No, no, no







Can't say no







Oh, no

I can't say no







Go away







Leave me be







Just leave me be







So, what were the reactions you got

from those close?







I mean, how did the family react?







I'm just-- I don't know.

Sometimes I'm a real ass about it







and just come in and say,

"Oh, by the way,







I'm going to Russia for two weeks

right here."







You know, and, "What?" You know.







Yeah, I'm getting better at that,

you know,







because that was the most

I missed my family ever.







- You know?

- Right.







And it was, you know,

Castor's first birthday I missed.







- Right.

- And it was--







Of course, we had a little vodka

to Castor.







Did a little shot for him

and everything.







But I would've loved to have

been able to get ahold of home.







Who's here?







This is Daddy working.







- This is where Dad works?

- Yeah.







- What does your dad do for work?

- Drums.







- He plays drums?

- Yeah.







- Let me play drums.

- Is he good at it?







- Daddy, wanna play drums?

- I played drums a lot today already.







I'm okay. You play for a while.







- Those guys,

- That's very good.







you know, their plate is filled

with many, many things.







And music is just one of the things.







- Say, "Bye, James."

- Bye, James.







Bye, buddy.







I chose not to have children

and do those kind of things.







My music, that's my children.

You know?







Daddy's gonna stay and work

for a little while.







But since I decided to do it

with music,







then that's what I have

to fill my time with.







Echobrain is one of the projects

that I've been working on for years.







And now it's come to fruition.







And then when it comes to the time

where my main cat, James,







tells me that basically

he couldn't be in a band with me







if I did the--

Took this other project to this level.







And after    years of working

together and going on buses







and, you know, the stories, man...







There was no way that this thing

that I was doing







could affect the monster of Metallica.

I just don't see how it could.







And so-- And saying things like that,







I couldn't accept that kind of







limited acceptance.







I also know that this relationship

is not over.







You know, he'll-- It'll come

around again at some point.







You guys will make contact.







At that time the managers suggested







that we have a psychotherapist

come in,







a man that meets

with pro-ball teams,







you know, big-ego, big-dollar guys

that can't get along







but have to make

some kind of entity flow







so everybody else and everybody

can make their money.







And I actually said:







"I think that this is

really fucking lame







and weak that we

cannot get together. Us.







Look, the biggest heavy band

of all time.







And the things we've been through,

and decisions we've made







about squillions of dollars

and squillions of people.







And this, we can't get over this?"







Was it more than just

the Echobrain thing?







Because that's, like, you know,

what has been discussed.







He felt like he wasn't free enough

to do what he needed to do.







Since he wasn't getting his creativity

out enough in Metallica,







he needed to get it out

somewhere else.







And I totally understand that now.







And...







On my side of that was,







I didn't want him to enjoy that

more than Metallica.







I didn't want anyone

to leave Metallica.







I didn't want to feel

that we weren't enough







or something like that.







And it was-- Through my--







I guess the way I learned how

to love things







was just to choke them to death.







You know?

"Don't go anywhere. Don't leave."







You know?

"You have to stay here."







Okay.







Need a pen, none of this pencil shit.







Check it out, man,

he can't even fucking spell it right.







"Metllica."

We've only been together    years.







I feel guilty that I'm not inspired

all the time.







You know, especially

when everyone else is.







It's like, "Okay."

We kind of get to the point







where the song is looped twice

in the Pro Tools,







and I know Bob's gonna hit me up

for some kind of lyric ideas.







"Oh, shit." I was, like,

dreading the whole process.







It's like, "Why are you dreading it?

Why don't you just--?"







Well, you're dreading it

because of what?







- Let's get to the fear.

- Well, because I didn't have anything.







- And so if you didn't have anything--

- Wasn't inspired enough







to have something or letting down

the team or some vibe like that.







One, two, three, five.







Say it, I'm lonely, yeah







Motherfucking in my head







It's like I'm almost,

like, racing against time.







There's, like, weird-ass fear of like:







"I gotta come up with something

myself really quick







before somebody else comes up

with something for me."







And then if I don't like it

or don't     percent embrace it,







then I'm just being a selfish,

you know, insular asshole.







It's a fear response.

When we're up against a fear,







that's the time to move into it,

forward.







Because there's going to be

some kind of genius there







or some kind of breakthrough.







Motherfucker, yeah







Metallica. Metallica.







Kirk.







Kirk.







Kirk. Kirk!







- Kirk.

- Kirk!







- Kirk.

- Kirk!







- Yes.

- Kirk.







- James is trying to talk to you.

- Sorry, man.







Yeah, it's a bit stock.







Check it out, guys.







I don't know how you feel.

I'm in a shit mood.







And I'm not digging it right now.







Even last night, I gotta tell you,

everybody kind of looked--







I hate to tell you, looked pretty burnt.







I agree.







And if we don't start earlier

and end earlier, I'm just--







I'm not gonna be in a good mood

for the rest of this shit, you know?







That was totally weird for me.







You hear that, Bob?







Why don't you try getting

a more solid beat.







- Regular.

- Oh, well, you can call it regular.







- You called it regular.

- No, I'm trying not to call it regular,







because I know it bugs you

when I call it regular.







So a little more solid, then.







Fuck!







Maybe we should talk

about next week.







- Well, all next week is therapy.

- Yeah.







Do we have to do that?

Can we sack Phil?







I mean, we gotta find--

We gotta find a balance to not--







You know, the Phil stuff's important,







and I hope we all feel that that's

an investment in the music.







It's an important part of the record.







Get all holy again







Let me just go put one together.







Get all holy again







- It's just real confusing sounding.

- It's just jacking the vocals all up.







I mean-- I mean,

it's clever and everything.







But, I mean, I don't see

what it does to the--







I think that's how you hear it, dude.

That's fine.







I'm just trying to do something

different.







I mean, I'm-- I'm used to having

the drummer do the beat part.







You know what I mean?

Holding it together.







What I'm hearing is...







Choose my words carefully here.







It's pretty straightforward.

And the guitar shit, it's--







You know, it's a little stock.







So I started trying to introduce

some kind of edge to it on the drums.







Those things we throw out

to each other are complete bullshit.







You know? "It sounds too stock.

It sounds too normal to me."







I mean--







You know what I mean?

You're saying this shit







so you can get your point across

about doing a drum beat.







I mean... You know,

it doesn't hold any water.







- To you.

- It doesn't.







I think it's fucking stock. What--?

Which part of that is unclear to you?







I think it sounds stock to my ears.







I mean, do you want me

to write it down? I think--







- Oh, yeah, please write it down.

- It feels stock, okay?







- I can't hear you.

- So l--







No, when you say-- You're telling

me what to play, right now.







You're telling me, "You should

play with what Kirk's doing."







- And I'm telling you it's stock.

- Dude, fine.







You know what, you guys, why don't

we just go in and hammer it out,







all right, instead of hammering

on each other.







We're in shit moods, and we're not

gonna get anything done here today.







- All you wanna do is pick a fight.

- I don't wanna pick a fight.







This is so silly.

You're just sitting there going:







"I'm in a really pissy mood and--"







And I fucking told you

straight up that I was!







- Right.

- And what are you trying to do?







I'm not trying to do fucking shit.







You're just sitting here

being a complete dick.







You're-- You're really helping matters.

You're really good at that.







I was straight up with you,

and I told you, I'm in a shit mood.







And what have you been doing?

Fucking picking at me all night.







Come on, guys.

We've got better things to do.







Yeah, I do. I do.







Metallica front man, James Hetfield,

has entered a rehabilitation facility







to undergo treatment for alcoholism

and other undisclosed addictions.







In a statement posted

on Metallica's official website,







the band writes, "James has entered

an undisclosed facility,







and he will continue to receive

treatment until further notice.







Until then we have postponed

all current activities,







including recording sessions

for our new album."







Metallica, whose hard-partying ways

earned them the nickname Alcoholica,







have been working on their follow-up

to the      double disc...







I think it's easy to see that,

in those days,







Metallica brought a kind of

physicality to rock 'n' roll.







Let's say the Beatles,

the Rolling Stones,







you know, and all that inspired

some of the British rock music







that then developed after that.







And let's say the metal music







and Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath

and all of that.







And then, out of that again,

then, let's say,







then came Lars

and all of that and being--







So I think that they have certainly

a place in all of that, I think.







Lars had a very good vision

at the time







of where he saw that particular--







You know, the metal music going,

because he could see it







with European ears and eyes maybe.







Don't you feel that it's great for you







to have your father's perspective on

who you are and what you're doing?







I think that's incredible.







You talk about the lineage...

Which we did,







we talked a little bit

about your grandfather.







It's very difficult to admit it,

especially with him standing next to me.







It's easier to talk about it

when he's not in my presence.







But...

Of course it is.







What would you--?

What would you say in private?







- To who?

- To anybody, without him here.







Say it.

You know, what would it be?







Well, I mean, I've already said it

to you countless times.







Well, have you said it to him?







You brought it up. I didn't bring it up.







What is it you feel you've said

that you're not saying now?







I think maybe in some ways

some of the--







To me that's--







Fear of status quo comes a little bit

from this direction over here.







I think that--

I mean, there's nothing worse







than when I have to go to him

and play the new record







and know there's something

on there that sucks.







And he can see right through that

in two and a half seconds flat.







Comments on that one?







I would say, you know, if you said:







"If you were our adviser,

what would you say?"







Then I would say, "Delete that."







I mean-- I mean,

I don't know for you guys.







For me, it doesn't cut it.

You know?







- But--

- Interesting. I mean, it's interesting.







You know, now-- I mean, other

than the people involved here,







the only other people who've heard

any of this music is Cliff Burnstein.







When Cliff Burnstein heard that, he

thought that should open the record.







Yeah. I mean, that could well be.







But I'm pretty sure that--







That I really-- That I really--

I really don't think so.







You know?

I really don't think so.







- Right.

- For me, that--







That doesn't sound right

or something. You know?







Unless I'm a guy

that's kind of shouting







in some kind of echo chamber.







So I think one

of our responsibilities here







is to act like a band

that's still continuing.







We're going on.

We're doing our exploring.







We're exploring ourselves individually,

we're exploring our relationships.







And we really need to get together,

talk about this,







act like the band exists,

because it does exist.







And if we don't do that,

then we are the coproducers







of the process slipping off the planet.







This is a bit

of a shit sandwich, though.







What does it--?

The unravelling of a band?







And then there were two?







So a good friend of mine

phoned me.







And he knew where James was.







- Really?

- Yeah.







He couldn't even imagine James

doing anything for six months.







I'm prepared for the worst.







I'm pretty confident that, you know,







we will come together

when the time is right.







But knowing when

that time will come,







or not knowing

when that time will come,







is very, very uncomfortable.







I hope that at some point

he will come back







and try and finish the making

of this record.







lf...







If he walked away from Metallica,

I'm not sure







that it would surprise me.







Say your prayers, little one







Don't forget, my son

To include everyone







I've always felt that James

was a softer, more caring,







compassionate person than he

allowed himself to be to most people.







I can remember

from the Dave Mustaine days,







I mean, when him and Dave Mustaine,

these guys, they started right away







with their big, you know,

chests beating and their mannerisms,







and the whole thing was very much

about this kind of, like, macho--







It was just, like--

I couldn't deal with that stuff.







And looking back on, I mean,

what was that,       years ago,







I mean, I just felt so alienated,

because it was just so far removed







from the upbringing

that I come from.







Well, here's to you, my friends.







But then, at the same time,

I'm starting to realizing now







that the sort of depressive things

that show up







as a result of the alcohol

and stuff like that,







it was just very difficult for him

to communicate from the heart.







- You want some or not?

- And not hide behind







a lot of these different fronts.







Whether it's alcohol, that gives

him a false sense of strength







or the front man in Metallica







or, you know, macho bullshit

and all that stuff.







All right, now you guys are drunk,

and I'm drunk.







Now this is the fun part, man.







I want to help him.

I want to be there for him.







And I want to do the best I can







to make him the best person

that he can be.







So I don't know how the fuck

it's gonna play out.







It's really healthy for me to be here

without any pressure







or anything related to the band







or anyone who would remind me

of the band.







And to recognize what's real.







Our sessions with Phil really stirred up

a lot of things in James







that he thought that he needed

to address.







Mentally, it's really taken--







Taken its toll on myself, you know,

and I'm very worried about him.







And, you know, whenever

you check yourself into rehab,







they don't-- They don't focus on, you

know, the fact that you're an alcoholic.







They go much deeper, you know?

I mean, they go way deep.







They crack you open

and then spill you out







and examine all the things

that are on the table.







I've spoken to him a few times,







and, you know,

I know he's having a rough trip.







No matter how bad it gets, eventually

things seem to sort themselves out,







sooner or later.







Whether it's good or bad,

they sort themselves out.







I watched the people

around the world say







what a great guitar player Kirk is







and what a piece of shit I am.

And that I got kicked out of Metallica.







And I wasn't good enough for them.

And that I was a loser.







And I've had to deal with that

for almost    years.







It's a dreadful experience.







It's been hard, Lars.







It's been hard to watch everything that

you guys do and you touch turn to gold







and everything I do fucking backfire.







And I'm sure there's

a lot of people that







they would consider my backfire

complete success.







You know? And am I happy

being number two? No.







You know? You're just now

encountering something







I've been going

through       years.







I've never had a chance

to be able to tell you without







talking to Lars, the guy in Metallica.







Never talked to my little Danish

friend again. You know?







I remember the day you and I talked

about digging a hole in fucking dirt







and smoking hash

through the ground.







That to me is the stuff that's, like--







You know? And we've never had

very many moments like that.







Do I feel some guilt? Yes, I do.







But at the same time,

it's difficult for me to comprehend







that the only thing that you feel







when you look back

on the last    years







is rooted in the Metallica thing.







Okay.







Have you ever thought what--?

What I've been through?







I think I've had an awareness

of the pain I caused you.







That's not what I said.







Okay.







Do you have any idea--?







- Of what I put you through.

- No, no, no, what I went through.







I mean, people hate me

because of you.







You know, I walk down the street,

and I hear some piece of shit







say "Metallica" at me,

and they do that to taunt me.







I mean, when I would hear Metallica

on the radio,







I would be like,

"God, I have to turn this off,"







because I just keep thinking,

"I fucked up!"







Right.







I've been waiting for this day

for a long time.







You know? And by no means

is it done because







somebody else very important

is not here.







Right.







Do I wish it was      all over again,







and you guys woke me up and say:







"Hey, Dave, you know what?

You need to go to AA"? Yeah.







I'd give anything for that chance.







Is there any last words you wanna

say to everybody out there?







Metal up your ass!







Okay, thank you. This is Donna Davis,

and this is Metallica.







This is, like, a pretty bitchin' club

to play the first fucking gig.







- Yeah.

- How do you guys feel?







- Stoked.

- Freaking out.







- Freaking out?

- Totally. Totally.







It's un-fucking-believable is what

it comes down to. Can I say that?







- You can say whatever you want.

- It's fucking unbelievable.







Echobrain. Yeah.







I don't know, I just-- All of a sudden

this became such a big production.







I don't understand.

It's like all of a sudden, like--







I get one phone call, it's like everybody

and their fucking brother are in town.







I thought it'd be Jason, like,

playing with his new band







in front of, you know, like,    drunks

down at some bar or something.







And now, I guess, to my own

ignorance or something, l--







That's what-- I guess that's

what I wanted it to be.







So now I'm realizing that supposedly

it's a little more of a big deal than that.







- Hey, what's happening, man?

- What's going on?







- Sounded good, man. Very good.

- Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.







- Awesome. Awesome.

- Oh, thanks. Right on.







- I'm Lars. How you doing?

- Nice to meet you.







Where's Jason?







- Jas?

- I don't know.







I think he went back to--

I think he already fucking bailed.







- He went back to--

- Really?







Nice. Go back to say hey,

and he's, like, fucking gone.







Elvis has left the building.







There's Zach. Hey, Zach.







See, he's even blowing me off.







Jason blows me off.

Zach blows me off.







How quick we become

yesterday's news.







No-- No kidding.







See, there's a guy

in an Echobrain T-shirt.







Yeah, that's Steve over there.

He works at the studio with us.







Well, he is.







- Really?

- Yeah.







I remember that guy.







I remember him.

He worked at the studio.







- Which guy?

- Over there.







- The guy in the red shorts?

- No, the guy in the black







that's walking across right now.

Kessel.







Todd. He works at the studio too,

doesn't he?







- Who?

- Todd over there.







I'm sure they're all here, Bob.







I mean, the only two people

in the Bay Area







not working for him is me and you.







Hetfield's gonna freak.







I'm in fucking hell.







This whole gig has brought

all of this on.







Yes, it has.

It's made me feel like--







- You really wanna come clean.

- It made me feel like such a loser.







I mean, I can't hold my band together,

you know.







I start records,

I don't finish them.







I fucking--







Jason is the future.

Metallica's the past.







I've never had a break like this

in    years.







Do you know what I mean? And just--

What's been kind of getting me







is just not knowing.







You know what I mean? Not knowing

and not hearing, it just eats away at you.







- Kirk talked to him.

- I talked to James today.







What did he say?







He basically said that,

you know, he just--







His family's the priority right now,







and he needs time to work

on his family







before he can reach out

to his other family, being us.







And that he loves us,

and he just needs for us







to understand that he needs time.







And he also went on

about how difficult it was







talking to you about it,

because he felt pressured.







And, you know, he spoke

about how you always need







to be in control of the situation or in

control of the schedule or whatever.







And he said that this is a time







he needs complete control

of the situation.







And he said, you know, all the

Marc Reiters and the Bob Rocks,







all that stuff, you know, just has--

"I can't think of that right now."







So, you know, I got the feeling that

he kind of lumps in your relationship







with the business side of things,







which was actually

really surprising to me.







But I think that's--

You know, that explains--







I think that explains a lot

on why he hasn't spoken to you.







We're just in limbo, and the longer

James chooses to stay away







from dealing with us,

the further we drift apart.







And I just feel so disrespected.







And that's the key thing.







Was the future of the group

ever in doubt?







Even when James went

into rehab, do you think?







Lars and I, we were wondering







when James was going to finally feel

like he was in a situation







where he can come back

to the band.







And after a certain amount of months,

you know, Lars and I started to think:







"Well, is he ever gonna come back

to the band?"







And that was a really big question

on our plates.







Whether or not, you know,

he wanted to come back.







James wrote something in the new

issue of our magazine, So What!







He wrote a kind of

a little handwritten note.







That note was probably

the most heartfelt thing







that I'd ever seen come

from his mind.







Tomorrow is shaping up,

or is gearing itself up to be,







yes, the first sit-down

with one James Hetfield post-rehab.







Why are we filming this?







I don't know.







We're in very different places.







Or at least I am in a very different

place than I was from the Presidio.







That's a huge understatement.







So we just have to find that if--







You know, if the movie will be

as intense, you know.







To me there was a lot of intrusion,







and I kind of went with it and felt--







I felt uncomfortable.

I felt uncomfortable with it.







You know, a boom

following me around,







and it just felt like I was

in the spotlight all the time.







And I didn't--

I guess I don't really like that feeling.







While we were in the Presidio

filming you guys playing,







- did you feel it then too?

- Yeah.







It was-- It was pretty much

all the time.







Do you think you're

in a better place now?







- We gotta find some...

- I'm definitely in a better place.







Some place that

makes you feel comfortable.







And the last thing we wanna do

is have it impede on your music,







because that's more important

than anything.







You know, one answer

may be there--







Maybe there shouldn't be a film.







I mean, that's the range of possibilities

that we should really think about,







because, I mean,

why do you guys want a film?







Even you said you hope

that the film is made. I mean--







That's a big question,

because, for me, it was really just--







It came along with being in Metallica.







"Hey, we're gonna do this."

"Oh, okay."







That's part of this, all of this...







The bigness of Metallica,

and I'm kind of tired of it.







You might look at it as a friend.

To me, it's been a beast.







And it's sucked a lot of me into it.







You were maybe the keeper

of the beast at one point.







You know, because you were the

champion of that fifth-- That entity.







And, of course,

you gotta find the right balance







between what

everybody's personal needs are,







but if Metallica collectively decides

to do this,







then I think Metallica

can make it happen.







I don't know. That scares me again.







Metallica is three individuals.







And three individuals have to decide

if it's good to do.







But I still think that the priority

is the collective







until all the people involved

in the collective







say that the priority

is the individual.







And so far, you're the only one

that said the priority is the individual.







I haven't said that.

He hasn't said that.







I haven't heard him say that.







So I feel that it's still--

There's still an unbalance there.







We met from, like, maybe,

I don't know, six or eight weeks







before we actually picked up

the project again.







That was when we came in,

and it was the first time







we actually used this studio, HQ.







Anyway, here we are. HQ.







Right on. Well, we're here.







And the camera's here.







And my friend the boom is here.







- Hovering.

- Yeah. Cool.







Do you want me to play the music?







Yeah, let's go. I'm--







I'll put the big speakers on.







I was afraid to pick up a guitar

and fearful of what would happen.







Would I not like it? Would I love it?







Would I not be able to write

anything cool?







Would I write just recovery stuff?







James.







It was probably the best sound

I've ever heard in my life,







just the fact that you

were playing guitar in here.







- Hey, Zach.

- Right on, brother.







Play a riff.







- What?

- Nothing.







See? It feels pretty good, doesn't it?







- Yeah.

- It feels like the next day.







A year later, the next day.







It will be interesting

working on this schedule,







because we really haven't.

It's gonna be great.







And kind of the overview is, you know,

the less time we have here,







the more productive we'll be,

in a way, you know?







It's like we're more focused

on getting the stuff done.







That all sounds really good.

Okay. Now, let's revisit it in a week.







So I think that, don't talk it, walk it.







At some point, we are gonna

have to work a little harder.







- Yes.

- You know, when that feels right.







What do you mean?

What does that mean?







- What does that mean?

- Yeah.







When you say harder,

does that mean more hours?







You know, if we can go deep

real quick,







be intense...







I spoke up because,

"What does that mean,







we have to, you know,

do eight hours now?"







- And I got fearful right then.

- That's okay.







I mean, it's like... Yeah.







- To do eight hours?

- No.







Any lyric ideas?







I'm searching for--







Searching for doughnuts.







- Searching for doughnuts

- Searching for doughnuts







What was the whole thing

from yesterday?







- The Buddhist--

- Guarantee-- What?







No, the Buddhist thing that you had.







Birth is pain, life is pain,

death is pain.







The cycle of suffering.

It's called samsara.







Where are you with this, James?







Somewhere else.







Where's today's sweat going?







"I've worn out being afraid.

My endless parade







of fear that I've constantly made."







"My lifestyle determines

my deathstyle.







A rising tide that pushes

to the other side."







I've worn out being afraid

Endless parade







Of fear that I've constantly made







Frantic tick tick tick tock

I gladly trade







Oh, I need know the answer

Where I'll be laid







I can't find it







- It just-- It doesn't work.

- The great--







You did one great thing.

You went:







You did this one syncopated thing.







Do the whole verse like that.







I've worn out always being afraid







An endless stream of fear

That I've made







Frantic tick tick tock

I'll gladly trade







It's weird. It's weird. And it works.







No, but the second time you felt

really comfortable with it.







- Right.

- Oh, by the way, it's quarter to  .







I gotta get rolling, guys. Sorry.







I feel like the bad guy saying,

"I gotta go because it's  :  ."







If we all know, and we all do know,

that  :   is kind of the stop time,







then, I don't know, then I won't feel

like the heel here, saying:







"I gotta go eat dinner

with my kids," you know.







Because I have a feeling

I'm gonna walk out of here,







and you're gonna go in there

and listen to this stuff,







- and it's like, that's not right.

- That's not.







I mean, if I wanna listen to it,

I'll go and listen to it.







But we should at least listen to it--







But I know you'll sit there

and start talking with Bob.







Maybe Bob doesn't wanna sit

in there, and when I'm gone,







things get talked about

and decisions are made.







And I feel I walk into something

that's already kind of decided.







And it's a total uphill battle

for me a lot of times.







I don't like that feeling.







Well, that's, like,

just like the last    years,







- Yeah.

- for me.







Well, let's talk about this

tomorrow, then, all right?







- Or do you wanna take time out--?

- No, I don't have time right now,







because it's past  .







It's hard to introduce structure

into this, and I'm trying.







So, what do you think, Lars?







Can we hear the song

from yesterday?







That we all heard together?







How is that different?







Because we all heard it

together already.







- He wants to be part of everything.

- Was I in there?







Yes, you were.

We all heard it together yesterday.







- You came in.

- All right.







As long as you don't talk about it.







- Is that a way around it, or--?

- That is definitely a way around it.







How about if we just save up

the tension?







Seriously. I mean, that's okay,

because tension produces results.







I'm excited to see

what you learned here.







Up and back. Up and freeze.







What is this called?







Arabesque.







Super proud of you, sweetie.







I'm so glad I got to see it.







I'm working on--

Really hard, on being







the best dad and father

and husband I can be.







And the best me.







You worked hard.







I don't wanna lose

any of the stuff I have.







I know it could all go away

at one time,







and that's a tough part of life.







And then-- And it's just--

It's a total rebirth for me,







looking at life in a whole new way.







You know, all the other drinking and

all the other junk that I was stuck in,







it was so predictable, so boring.







I'm out there looking for excitement

in all this stuff.







The results are the same, man.







I wake up the next day somewhere

in some bed,







I don't know who this person

is next to me,







and I'm drunk, completely hung-over

and have a show to do.







And the result is the same.







You know?

When life now is pretty exciting.







You don't know

what's gonna happen







when you're kind of clear

and here and in the now.







In the moment.







My lifestyle determines

My deathstyle







A rising tide

That pushes to the other side







My lifestyle determines

My deathstyle







A rising tide

That pushes to the other side







I think those two feel the best to me.







It's a tough one to decide.

They all kind of got







some charm, don't you think?







Yeah, I'd be interested to hear

the first one.







From the first take.







Well, let's play it.







- Is it okay?

- Are we allowed?







- Yeah, we are.

- Do we have--?







- We never really settled that, did we?

- We didn't settle it.







Yes. We're allowed.

Well, I'd like to hear it.







Feel free to leave the room, whoever

doesn't want to be part of that.







I felt like it was an agreement.

We're gonna work from    to







and then we would not work.







Well, if Lars and I

listen to something







or go through the Presidio stuff,







it's not because we wanna do

something behind your back.







It's for you.







And basically what I heard

is, "No, I can't do that."







- What the fuck is that?

- I don't know, my mind gets lopsided.







The more it goes in a different

direction, the harder it is.







The harder it is to get that back.







What is it you have to get back?







Some control. Some sense

of involvement in the band.







When I was running this morning,

I was thinking about seeing you today,







and the word "fuck"

just comes up so much.







Seriously, it's really true.







- Is that in anger?

- No, just, "Fuck!"







"Fuck."







I just think you're

so fucking self-absorbed.







And what makes it worse is

that you always talk about...







You always talk about me.

You use the word "control"







and "manipulation" a lot.

I think you control on purpose,







and I think you control inadvertently.







I think you control by the rules

you always set.







I think you control by how you

always judge people.







I think you control by your absence.







I think you control all of this

even when you're not here.







I don't understand who you are.

I don't understand the program.







I don't understand all this stuff,

okay?







I realize now that I barely

knew you before.







And all these rules

and all this shit, man,







this is a fucking rock 'n' roll band.







I don't want fucking rules.







I understand that you need

to leave at  .







I respect it.







But don't tell me I can't sit and listen to

something with Bob at  :   if I want to.







What the fuck is that?







You know, I don't wanna end up

like Jason, okay?







I don't want to be pushed away.

I don't want it to happen twice.







Let's do it, and let's fucking do it

full-on or let's not do it at all.







Fuck. See?







Fuck.







Fuck!







Fuck!







Yeah!







- Yeah!

- Metallica. Yeah!







Rock 'n' roll.







Let's hear it for Elena!







We're not anywhere near

getting any issues resolved.







Well, let's get them.

That's what we're here to do.







I don't know. I guess the playing part,

being in the room,







and then mainly being in the room

with Lars, playing music together.







I guess I had higher expectations,

and I don't know,







maybe I'm disappointed in myself.







Maybe... I don't know.







You wanna talk about that?

I mean, what does that mean?







I'm not enjoying being in the room

with you playing.







Searching







Seek and destroy







Searching







Seek and destroy







Searching, yeah







Seek and destroy







If you are not having any fun,







let me let it be known to you that

I'm not having a lot of fun either.







But I've-- I am not interested

in playing music with you







if you're not happy in there.







I just don't want to be a--

Become a fucking parody.







Okay? So if you're not happy

playing music with me:







Is there enough that connects us

to hold on







for a way through this?







I don't know.







There are moments

where I really doubt it.







Really doubt it.







I'm glad you said that.







Because I really, deep down,

feel sometimes that it's just...







There's just some empty, just...







Just an ugly feeling inside.







Just... I don't know.







How much work

do we gotta put into this?







- Then you're doing the:

- Yeah.







Let's do our little roundtable thing

right now, quickly.







Everybody's gotta participate.







Lars, come on.







Hey, Castor, why don't you look at all

the boys-- The men, I should say.







And say bye to everybody.







Bye, Castor.

Thank you for coming.







- Is Daddy going bye?

- No, your dada's staying here, okay?







- Bye, guys.

- See you.







So, what's the deal? How does

everybody feel about what they heard?







The chorus lyrics will definitely work

in that feel.







- Yeah.

- That kind of intro bit that's on there.







- What about you? What do you think?

- It's good.







You think it's good? Was there

anything in particular that you...?







No, I wasn't paying attention

that detailed.







That's just-- It's a lot of good stuff.







I can take you back, when me and him

were alone in my room, in







listening to the new wave of

British heavy-metal singles.







As soon as there was somebody else

in the room,







it just became this, like-- It just had

a very different energy to it.







- Is there any of that that's usable?

- Yeah.







- That's a fuck-- That's a fucking bitch.

- Let's do another version of it, okay?







The first time I got

a real awareness of it







was when Mustaine came

into the picture.







When James was with Mustaine,







he became like he never

really cared about me.







One time during the recording

of the Ride the Lightning record,







where me and him went out and--

So    beers later,







it was like, "Oh, dude, I love you."







But it could never have materialized

until it got to that   -beer point







and we were alone.







That was good.







Are you sure I don't have

to play it again?







Yeah, I'm sure.

It's good practice, though.







- For what?

- The road.







- When?

- A couple years.







From day one, it's been competitive.







And in a way, that's what has made

Metallica what it is.







That's what's driven us further.







What feels good to you?







I don't know.

I'm gonna try a bunch more.







Can you try maybe like a:







Almost like a strum.







My parents split

when I was    or   .







And then my mom passed on

when I was   .







The only thing I felt that I really had,

at that point, was music.







My wanting to keep everything

under control,







and, you know, it's out of a fear

of my abandonment issues.







I'm afraid to get close to people

because I don't know how to do it.







I don't know

how you're supposed to do it.







- Cool.

- That last one was pretty good.







Yes.







That's the first amp I ever owned.







That right there.







I think we have it.







Okay.







Okay. Now we gotta talk about it.







You started talking about the idea of

the guitar solo, as we have known it,







maybe being something that was

a little outdated







and maybe reintroducing

some riff-o-rama things.







But can I say something

that I think is bullshit?







This whole fucking solo out,

you know, dates the whole thing.







That's so bullshit. You know?







If you put a guitar-- If you don't play

a guitar solo in one of these songs,







that dates it to this period.







And that cements it to a trend

that's happening in music right now.







I think that's stupid,

and I think it's totally trendy.







I know that's not what I said.

It's always been about,







like, where could it go

that's kind of new and interesting,







instead of just repeating

something from the past.







I'm not interested in playing

traditional guitar solos anymore.







- You know, that's just-- For me, it's--

- And you told me that.







It's just boring, you know.







To me, if you can add a colour

to the song







that satisfies you and works

for the song,







then that's what we should do with it.







But I don't wanna get in the position

where it's like,







we put something down on the tape

to satisfy your ego,







my ego, Lars' ego or James' ego.







I think it should serve

what's going down.







Like, in other words, there shouldn't be,

like, a rule of no solos.







There shouldn't be a rule of solos.

It should be--







And I agree.

I mean, it really is, to me,







all about serving the song,

and, you know,







I feel much better about that,







because, you know, I just don't wanna

follow certain trends







that I see other bands following.







We don't necessarily have

to stick to our traditional way,







but we also don't have

to follow that trend.







I'm actually very, very comfortable

with my role in the band, you know?







I've actually always been very, very

comfortable with my role in the band.







I'm not a really egotistical person.







In fact, I've-- I spend a large

amount of my time trying to, like,







downplay my ego

and get it even smaller and smaller.







That's part of my beliefs.







I try to be an example

of being egoless to the other guys.







Hi! This is Kirk from Metallica.







And if you want money,

you'll listen to us.







And then some other guy's

gonna give you cash.







Twenty years' worth of integrity,







and, you know,

credibility and all that.







The next five minutes

is gonna change all that.







"Hey, man, keep it locked right here,

and--" What?







"We'll help you score $    ."







This is James from Metallica.

Survey says, you need cash.







Your money-shot to snatch

a bunch of cash is coming soon.







In order to suck both

nationwide radio chains off,







we are now standing here

having to do this fucking stupid thing.







Up to    motherfucking grand,

goddamn it!







Win a bunch of money.







And walk away.







This is stupid!







Sharpen that booger-picking finger







and be the   th--







Hey, it's Lars from Metallica. I'm

about to stick    grand up your ass.







One dollar at a time.







I was telling Lars last night

that was hard for me to see







- you guys squirm like you were.

- Yeah.







Because I wanted to say anything,

and it's not my place to say anything.







I can't imagine Bono or the Edge

going on the radio,







saying what you guys

are being asked to say.







- Dad, can I have one of those?

- Go for it.







Should we catch up

on all this radio stuff?







Okay. Now, they're

the biggest chain in America.







You know, it's like       stations

or something.







And if you guys think it's crappy, as a

radio thing, those guys think it's good.







I mean, that's their idea.

We didn't come up with that.







So strategically--







Why are we doing it, then?

Just to make them happy?







Yes.

That's exactly what they're doing.







And they won't say, "Fuck you,

you never do anything for us.







We're gonna fuck you

on the next record. "







People would do that?







"Because you didn't give us something,

we're gonna fuck you?"







Yes, James. They would.







I'm not saying that they

can always get away with it.







That's so funny.







- It wouldn't stop them from trying.

- I'm glad it's your world.







I understand the "wash your back,

you wash mine" thing.







"Wash my--" "I'll wash your back

so you don't stab mine,"







- Right.

- is more like it.







Okay. Why don't we get off

the phone, then.







Well, you know, we should have this

conversation some more next week.







- Later.

- Okay.







- See you.

- Bye-bye.







That's insanity. "We're gonna hurt you

because we didn't get something."







I wash your back

so you don't stab mine.







Well, that's a good line for a song.







I guess I just want something

to rhyme with "mine" right now.







Wash your back so you won't...







Wash your back

so you won't stab mine.







Step on a landmine.







Keep you in my back pocket.







Blind leading the blind.







I'll rip out your fucking spine.







Okay.







All right.







Wash your back

So you won't stab mine







Get in bed with your own kind







Wash your back

So you won't stab mine







Get in bed with your own kind







- That was really good.

- Are you pulling my mike?







- That was really good.

- It was.







- Really good.

- So then, the part--







Landmine







Landmine







No landmines







No landmines

Rock lobster







Wash your back

So you won't stab mine







Get in bed with your own kind







There's a witch at the foot of my bed.







Did you--?

Did you hear what Lars said?







He says, "Yeah, Kirk stopped reading,

and I stopped moping."







- That's what you said.

- That's not what I said.







- What'd you say?

- I said, I stopped sulking.







Oh, sulking.







Shit!







In the    months since he's

parted company with Metallica,







ex-bassist Jason Newsted has been

apparently more musically active







than his former band mates.







While Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich

was pursuing Napster,







and singer James Hetfield

battled alcoholism,







Newsted hooked up in the studio

with legendary metal band Voivod.







Our own lann Robinson got all the

answers on Newsted's new ventures







and the current state

of his relationship with Metallica.







A good friend hinted







that Jason would really like

to join the band again.







Man, I popped his little bubble

for a second and-- I don't know, man.







I'll be quite honest.







I think the heart and soul of Metallica,

from this point on,







and has been for a while, since

Cliff died, is the three of you guys.







I think you will never, ever, ever find

a permanent bass player.







My opinion.







There was also tragedy

in rock this week.







Metallica's bassist Cliff Burton

was killed in a bus accident







while the band was on tour

in Sweden. He was   .







Metallica bassist Cliff Burton

was buried on Tuesday







in the San Francisco area.

Remaining members of the band...







Jason Newsted.

He replaced Cliff Burton,







who was killed in an auto accident

in September.







Jason told...







It pisses me off that Cliff left us







because we'd never have

that initial four guys







just going on and on.







You know, when I talk about it,

it's like that happened for a reason.







And we're-- We're dealing with that.







I gotta capitalize

on what's being said right here.







The Cliff message that I get

from him to you guys is,







that treasure the three of you.







Treasure every moment

that the three of you have.







And the four of you have.

You know, treasure--







Treasure it because you never know.







And one of the sad things

that happens when somebody dies







is that people have never

taken the time along the way







to really embrace each other

every day. You know?







It's a sin if you--

You know, if you let that go.







Phil has been like an angel for me.







He's been sent to help me.







And, you know, I've got

my own thoughts about all that,







you know, a father figure,

the dad that never was







and all of that, that it makes

me comfort--







It comforts me.







But also, we don't want to have

our hand held through life.







We'd like to be able to stand proud

ourselves and move on.







There'll be a time for that.







And we just have to discuss

when that is.







You know, there is purpose

behind the way I do it.







I think it's very effective.







I have to decide whether

I'm going to push it or not.







It sometimes is a distraction.







So, what part of our career

are you gonna manage today?







I thought I'd do the whole thing,

since you guys can't do anything.







If you guys could run something,







then it would be easy to step back.

Because you can't, you know...







Is today the first day you're

gonna play drums?







- I don't wanna get into that.

- Okay.







No. I don't think

I'm gonna do the drums.







- I think it's time--

- Maybe I should.







- Yeah. I think it's time.

- Although, actually, I'm kind of...







Well, it's about the only thing

you haven't done.







- I haven't sung.

- Right.







We got to a point

where we sat down and told Phil







that we wanted to scale Phil back

to every other week.







And we were getting ready

to implement that







four weeks from when

the decision was made.







And two weeks

after the decision was made,







we had to sit Phil down and say

that we were not ready to do that.







Because we got really...







I don't know. Scared, I guess.







There were some things

that were going on at the time







that, really, Phil helped with a lot.







Live from the news leader

The Metallica v. Napster battlefield

moved to San Mateo today.







Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich

delivered a list of screen names







of people who have downloaded

the band's music online.







Metallica is suing Napster,

a website that provides software







which allows people to download

music on the Internet without paying.







Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich testified

before a Senate committee







earlier this month that Napster has

"hijacked our music without asking."







The band said

that over        people







are downloading its music for free.







A group of former Metallica fans

staged a protest at the courthouse.







I don't want anything to do

with Metallica anymore.







I'm gonna be trashing their CDs.

I took all my CDs,







and I'm gonna be destroying them.







Are you proud

of what you achieved with Napster?







Are you proud in hindsight

of what you pulled off?







Being the most hated man

in rock 'n' roll?







Yeah, that was-- That was my goal.







I got an idea.

I'm kind of bored this summer.







Everything's going a little too well.







Let's see, I wanna turn myself







into the most hated fucking

asshole in rock 'n' roll, yeah.







Like, good afternoon, my name is, you

know, like, Lars Ulrich, from Metallica.







I worked for years to get

where I am today.







Me and my buddy

James Hetfield here







have shed blood, sweat and beer

to get where we are today.







Beer, good.







Who do you think you are?

I mean, just, you know,







because you, like, made us rich,

you think you can get free stuff?







Songs that we spent upwards

of, you know,







like    to    hours writing

and recording.







Our team of lawyers and researchers

have your names,







and you Napster users, we'll see you

in jail getting gang-raped.







Some minutes

I have all this strength,







and I can stand there and just go,

"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.







I'm bulletproof, it doesn't matter.







I got Hetfield and Hammett,

and we're a team, and fuck you."







You know what I mean?

Five minutes later,







it means nothing, and I just

become really vulnerable.







You know,

we never sat there and thought







about where Napster

was gonna end up.







We never sat there and talked about

what shots we were gonna take.







We just sat there and thought about,

this was something we had to do.







So wait a sec.







That was awesome!







It's like I had to stay

on the course that I was on







and stay to my convictions,

but it was eating away at me inside.







And then maybe it could go

lyrically to:







"What difference did l/we actually

make?" It's a great question. Great.







And if that could-- It's like if that

question could get thrown out there,







but remain unanswered,

I think that's really strong.







All the shots I take







What difference did I make?







All the shots I take







I spit back at you







"All the shots I spit back at you."







That's awesome, dude.

Fucking...







- Fuck me.

- And the "what difference did I make"







- fit right in.

- Really awesome. Right on.







These two kicks,

are they the same as--?







- It's different.

- Okay.







Go to the master. What really gets

my dick hard is starting on:







You know, there.

Then these are awesome.







Lars, what I wanna know is,







do the four of you just go in there

and just jam?







You're hearing excerpts

of three-hour jams.







You're hearing-- Look at it as a funnel.







You're hearing the very part

of the bottom of the funnel.







- Right.

- You can almost equate







- what we're doing now to arranging.

- You're like Pollock, the painter.







He is. He's Pollock,

the funnel-arranger guy.







It's gonna sound fucking amazing

at the stadium







with        people

fucking raising the evil horns







up to the sky and saying,

"Metallica, baby."







Oh, can we fast-forward

to that right now?







I think what I'd like to do is,







I'd like to talk about

this touring thing that has come up.







We're very cognizant of the fact







that things have changed

for you guys.







And they've changed

for many, many reasons.







Why can't we figure out what works

best for everybody







in their personal lives,

plus what works best as a business?







What if you just do a stadium tour,







where you play Friday, Saturday

and Sunday,







and then you go home

the rest of the week?







I just wanna put out that,







you know, it might be a kind

of uncomfortable vibe here







because people might not know

how I'm feeling about touring,







and I don't really know either.

You know? Until I get there.







And, you know, I wanna tour.







I don't wanna fall off the wagon,

you know.







I don't wanna go out there--

I don't know what it's like.







Doing things for the first time again, as

I think I've said before, it's a little scary.







I don't know about you,

but it's, like, summertime.







And to me, it's fucking

beer-drinking weather, yeah?







Yeah. Well, I'm gonna take time

right now and fucking have myself one,







and I just wanna say cheers

to all you guys







and fucking thanks for coming down

and getting nutty with us. Cheers.







I blew my voice out

on the "Black Album,"







doing "So What," the cover song.







And we had a bunch of Metallica

songs to do after that.







And I went to this coach. I didn't--







I didn't wanna go. I was scared.







I thought he was gonna make me

sing operatic.







But I went there,

and we just did warm-up stuff like this,







and this is the tape. And I've had

this same tape for-- Since then.







- Was there a turning point?

- Yeah.







I think when we had accumulated

what we thought to be,







you know, a great kind of...







I don't know,

cross section of material,







we took stock, so to speak.







The only songs that

are gonna make it to the album







are the songs that

all four of us vote on.







And out of   -plus songs,

only four songs got all four votes.







Sweet Amber

Sweet Amber







Sweet Amber







How sweet are you?







How sweet does it get?







How sweet are you?







How sweet does it get?







- Yeah, right.

- Wow.







I mean, there's some explosive playing.

The shit just takes off.







It's like you guys have spent

all this time







to come back to find yourselves.







- That's what it sounds like to me.

- All right,    to go.







Yeah, how are you doing?

Do you wanna hear more?







- Wanna hear more?

- I'm just getting started.







Squeeze all within my hands







Choke within my hands







I'm madly in anger with you

I'm madly in anger with you







I'm madly in anger with you







Time, time, times like this







- Boy

- You got what you're coming to







- So

- Destruct the power within all







Across your spine

So that gets broken too







Temptation, fill no hole







No







No, no







Temptation







You know, the first four songs

you've played me,







all pretty much knocked me out.







Okay? But if you've got it going, you

want it to hammer all the way through.







You want people to be able

to really listen and say:







"Jesus Christ, there's

no letting up from these guys.







There's no fucking letup."







Fuck ballads. You know?







There definitely is some Presidio stuff

that I felt, maybe--







You gotta analyse it. Maybe you're







watering it down in some way.

That's all.







- It's your call.

- Yeah.







I know that...







"Temptation,"

I remember writing that thing.







It came out.

It flowed, totally, instantly.







"Temptation" kind of sums up

all the lyrics







that are in this new kind of project.







So-- And that-- And it's cool

because that was done







long before recovery

and all that, so...







I mean, I can tell that you're singing

your heart out.







You're definitely wearing your heart

on your sleeve on that song.







To me, it's more like a jam.







Is there a song in there?







Potentially.







You know, there's almost nothing

there that can't be turned







into something better than it is

or something







that could probably

get pretty fucking close







to being something

on a Metallica record.







You know, but then it just goes away

from what the purpose--







At least, what I see the purpose

being today,







which is show up with what you--







You know, what are your A-pluses?

You know?







Well, when I hear Lars talk

about "We can whip anything







into decent shape," I agree.







And we did that on

Load and ReLoad.







And this is us trying to choose







before we take it to those extremes,

you know?







- Exactly.

- That makes sense.







That was a pretty major thing that I

think Lars and I clicked on together,







that, wow, I'd heard him,

and he heard me.







Oh, it's like, "Oh, okay."







It's like it takes the cutting edge

off of it







or the personal attack off of it,

you know?







Things are a lot less dramatic

than they used to be







within the chemistry

of the four of us.







Less head games, abuse of power

and soap-opera bullshit.







But can we just do one thing?







For lack of a better word,

when it comes in with the drums,







I just want you to scream,

"Fuck,"







as hard as you can fucking scream.







Fuck







Okay. It should be slower.







It should be more like:







I want four of them. Do it again.







Lars is selling paintings







because he's ready to move on

to the next ten years







or next decade

or next phase of his life.







And a lot of what these paintings and

a lot of what this house represents







is the last ten years versus

a husband and father of two.







He's getting rid of some pretty

major and important pieces







in the majority of his collection.







He's wiping the slate clean.







Midnight, New York City.







One last look at the paintings.

Oh, well.







- It's a celebration.

- This is a celebration.







- Of how far you've come.

- It's a celebration.







With Phil Towle.

This is a celebration.







Some paintings have visited us

for a while.







And now we wanna share them

with other people.







- Okay?

- Right, yeah. That's it.







- It's a choice.

- Okay, cool.







I never looked at it as an investment,

but I always looked it as--







Versus some of the other guys

that may be, like, taking







a big pile of money and parking

it in the bank,







I would always, like, take a big pile

of money and park it on my wall.







I can just feel some of the adulation

that other people have thrown







at these paintings,

and that makes me proud.







I've never been this close to it.







These are great paintings, whether

they sell for a dollar or for $    million.







The only thing that matters

is what pleasure







and what feeling you get out of that

moment you have with that painting.







And it's never been

about dollars and cents.







It's always been about something

greater than that.







But, fuck, they do look awesome.

I mean, fuck.







It's been a good time.







- And it will be a good time.

- To the future.







I feel better about this

than I thought I would, actually.







- It's weird, I don't know why.

- Yeah.







Shit.

It went well.







I got myself drunk to numb the pain.







But it went well. I'm happy.







Like, let's talk about the zone

for a minute.







Because there is a way to help

a person-- Persons get in a zone.







To-- I mean, you could consider

seriously doing some meditative,







or apply the meditative principles

to music, all right?







I don't want this to sound

too way-out,







but if you do that,

the four of you are out there,







and you do it anyway, unconsciously,

you do a musical meditation







by starting to jam with each other.







I just think,

no matter how you look at it,







I've been making records a very

long time, and it really comes down







to how much work you put in

and how much...







You know, it's just tough. Sometimes

it's just-- It's just tough work.







And I like to stretch the frontiers

of what people accept, okay?







And I understand about that.

And l--







I don't want, for my mind, to settle...







I guess I'm not gonna

be playing today, then, huh?







Well, I'm gonna go out

and make phone calls.







So everybody's...







You know, we've had

a fabulous few weeks







with a lot of great productivity,

a lot of really good stuff going on.







The more we feel good

about ourselves and each other







and the higher we ascend,

the more challenging







it will be to our psyches.







You know, I understand it.

I embrace it and all that stuff,







but sometimes it just bugs me.







I think the-- That thing was

kind of bugging me yesterday.







All of them around the studio,

it was just kind of, like--







That way of thinking, it just

doesn't work for me all the time.







And I was a little pissed off at it,







because right now in my life

it's not really working for me.







- I'm glad to know that's how you feel.

- I agree with that wholeheartedly.







And if you feel that way

and wish to share that more directly,







- I'd appreciate that too.

- Rather than tearing the signs down?







- Yeah.

- We pay him $      a month







to be pretty much available

at our beck and call.







So when this record's done,







do we want to collectively end

the $     -a-month, full-on thing?







I'm afraid he's under the impression

that he's, like, in the band, you know?







Yeah.







And I see him coming on the road,

maybe, for a week.







But after that I don't-- I don't see him







holding our hand

any further than that.







So is that something we wanna

present to him, then?







- Yeah. I think that--

- Okay.







I think it's something--

Yeah, I think it's something







we need to do

for our own well-being.







Yeah, because

I'm feeling uncomfortable.







Yeah, hello? Hello, hello.







Are they on the phone?







They're on the phone,

and they need you.







Oh, okay.







- James Hetfield is in the room.

- Hey there.







- Hey, James, how you doing?

- Pretty good.







I'll let Marc do the talking. He's

the one who's been talking to MTV.







Okay, this afternoon,

the official offer came in for ICON.







- Assuming you wanna do it.

- Let's do it.







Cool, man.

Yeah, I'm jazzed about it.







The only thing that you guys

are required to do







is show up for rehearsal

and then show up







for the show on the  rd,

and at the end of the show







you guys take the stage

and perform a little bit.







- So, what's Jason's role in all this?

- What? Who?







Cliff? I mean,

I don't think Jason has any role.







He lost his icon status

when he left Metallica.







- Nice one, Cliff.

- Thank you.







I think MTV would like the fact

that this would most likely be







the introductory performance

of Metallica with a new bass player,







whether it's the new member

or whoever.







When is it supposed to be?

May what?







May  rd. Saturday, May  rd.







See, that means you'd have

to hire someone by the  nd.







- Okay.

- I think it can happen.







You'd be required to be in

Los Angeles for all of two days...







Because we didn't get a new

bass player, I think a lot of people







thought maybe that we were

having trouble finding one.







We never started looking for a new

bass player until two months ago.







We worked on ourselves,

identified what part can we work on







so when someone else steps in,

it's clean.







They're not stepping in our shit,

you know?







All right, thinking about

bass players, finally?







So we're gonna need

a fourth member.







You know, we know you're

a great bass player. It's the vibe.







We need to make sure...







Jason kind of triggered this whole thing

a couple of years ago.







And I can't believe it's been two years.

And now we've gone through some...







We realized that we kind of wanted

somebody who was, like, our age.







Somebody who had been

around the block a couple times.







We've grown a lot, man.

These three guys







and this band.







And last time, when we did this

years ago,







years ago, I guess it was,







we literally sat down and started

auditioning bass players,







you know, the day after

the funeral for Cliff.







So now it's    years later,

different circumstances.







When Jason left,

he took his basses with him.







Do you want a four or five?







Whatever.

What five-strings do you have?







This one's a five-string.







Keep searching







Keep on searching







This search goes on







This search goes on







The band-- These guys

collectively probably own,







like, five to     guitars,

so they're not all here.







On and on







Tick tick tick tick tick tick tock

Frantic







Tick tick tick tick tick tick tock

Frantic







Tick tick tick tick tick tick tock

Frantic







Tick tick tick tick tick tick tock







You went into

another voice there, dude.







Which one of me are you talking to?







Think that we should just spend the

next two and a half hours with this guy.







Don't you?







I had a vision of us jamming

with him the last hour.







I guess I just feel this is just

kind of, like, weird to keep,







like, just doing our own thing.

It just feels not welcoming.







This morning I heard him say

he was pretty comfortable.







It's not about what he says.

It's about what I feel.







- All right?

- Are we cool, James?







Yeah. I guess the only other thing

I'd like to say is,







you know, when we leave this up

to just how we're feeling,







a lot of it depends

on how you're feeling.







You know,

when you say those things.







Not that I wanna break up

what you guys are discussing,







if you wanna go deeper, you know?







But I think what might be really good

is to treat this with respect,







go out and do this...







Metallica stuff?







- I could try "Battery."

- "Battery"?







You can play that fast

with your fingers?







Battery







That's a fucking pretty mighty

bass sound you got going there.







- Yeah, it's fucking--

- I don't know.







It's the Mesa and the Hiwatt.







Is there anything else you know

as well as that?







Cliff. It was just like you saw Cliff,







and me and James went,

"He's in our band, there's no question."







He hit it out of the park.







And that's where it

sort of gets interesting.







Because if Cliff Burton

showed up today,







maybe he wouldn't be the guy either.







I mean, the three guys that I like

all have unique features







that I would love to Frankenstein,

you know?







- Yeah! Definitely.

- Some kind of monster?







That would be great.







I don't think you should settle.

I think you should get the right guy.







If you don't hit it out of the park

with one of these guys,







then you're gonna end up

four years down the road







in the same situation you did

with Jason.







A four count, then...

And into the solo.







Just follow.







He was the first guy of any of them







- that didn't look like he was struggling.

- That's what I told Bob.







Do you know what I mean

about, like, it--?







You know, with some

of the other guys,







it was sort of    percent

over their capabilities,







or something like that. You don't

feel that with this guy at all.







It's like the last three songs,







like "Sanitarium," "Nothing Else

Matters" and what was...?







- "Sad But True."

- "Sad But True," they were flawless.







I looked over at him

during "Whiplash,"







and he was just right in the pocket

and in there.







And then afterwards, when he

played it alone with his finger,







it hadn't been played that way

since Cliff.







It's just, like:







- Yeah.

- Yeah, his finger's a pick, you know?







- Yeah.

- Yeah, it's three picks.







All right, are we

gonna sack Bob now?







Well, the second time

you came back,







I mean, that was, for me,

when I noticed







that you make us play better, man.







You make the band sound

so much better.







- So solid.

- How do you feel about that, man?







Well, I feel awesome, man.







- You're the chosen one.

- You looked coolest.







And we want you to be a real member

of this band, not just a hired hand.







And we'd like to offer you--

Basically, to give--







To show you how serious

we are about this,







offer you a million dollars

to join our band right now.







- And--

- Wait, okay.







And as a kind of a good-faith thing

about how serious we are--







It's an advance.

It's an advance on some percentage







you're gonna be making

with the band.







Here's money up front to get you

kicked in and inspired and:







"This is a reality. This is my future.

This is what life can hold for me







with my new family."







I can't really talk right now.







Invisible kid

Never see what he did







Got stuck where he hid

Falling through the grid







Invisible kid

Got a place of his own







Where he'll never be known

Inward he's grown







Invisible kid

Never see what he did







Got stuck where he hid

Falling through the grid







Invisible kid

Got a place of his own







Where he'll never be known

Inward he's grown







There's things that I miss,

and I'm sad it couldn't work out,







and things, you know, like that. But

there's way, way, way, way more times







and way more days and even hours

that go by and I'm reminded, "Dude,







all right.

You did the right thing."







You know, "You did the right thing

for yourself."







I don't know if it's the right time

to say this,







but, I don't know,

I've been thinking about our talk.







About, you know, you and us and

our future and all of that stuff, and...







And, you know, when I heard

that you guys were moving here







and all of that, that brought up

a lot of fear around:







"Wow, what is Phil's perception of,

you know, his, you know, longevity







with Metallica?" You know?

That scared me a little bit.







Well, I appreciate that. I was--







If it scared you, and that's part

of the issue going forward,







then let me say we haven't decided

we're moving here.







I've tried to make it clear

that we're selling--







I think we've told people we're selling

our house in Kansas City,







but that doesn't mean

we're moving here, okay?







And we won't likely move

to San Francisco







if there's not a future out there

with Metallica,







because, you know, that's my--







I wanna make sure

that the bass player's intact.







I wanna be sure that the tour's on.







And I also, as I said,

have performance-coach visions







for each of you and for the band.

And l-- To me, the work isn't over.







I'd like us to honour what we had,







and if you wanna be away from--







You know, on your own or something

for the couple of months







until we come back in June,

that's okay. I just kind of--







I don't know. I guess I have a problem







with the, "Let's see how it works out.

Let's see how it happens,"







and then, "No, let's honour what

happened, you know, six months ago."







You know? That's kind of strange

to me, you know?







Because I think that you use

those things







when they're convenient at times,

you know?







Personal stuff or business things.

And I don't know. I don't know.







They're-- The boundaries are--

I don't-- Becoming more clear to me.







There's that element of-- Of trust that

just kind of floats with you with me.







And l-- And that-- I'm really sorry

about that. That-- You know.







I've been swimming uphill on that one

for a long time with you,







and I'd like for us

to be able to resolve it.







But maybe we can't.







I've gotta tell you that l--

You know, if the client,







either James or us, says:







You know, then I really think that

needs to be respected without,







you know, just, you know,

the old turn-the-knife thing in there.







You know, it's just, you know,

if the client says,







you know, timeout for a while,

timeout.







That is great, although we--

Our process, what we normally do--







Then it should be put on the table,

but left on the table,







and should be able to walk away

without what you're saying right now,







which is now there are trust issues

and stuff.







I don't know how to separate out--







In its simplest form,

I think it's a conflict of interest







that you tell him that he needs

you around more.







- If he has--

- No, no, no, no, no.







I'm not saying that.







I see that as a conflict of interest.







Look, I am saying you guys

have made a decision.







It's okay for me to say

I'm not happy with that decision.







The premise is,

you guys don't need me.







And I'm good with that.







Anyway, you go... It's--







- Anyway, let's jam.

- Great, I'll see you guys.







I'm taking off. I'll see you

next week. Have a good one.







Thanks, man.







Who's in charge of my head today?







Dancing devils in angel's way







It's my time now

It's my time now







It's my time now

It's my time







Look out, motherfuckers

Here I come







I'm gonna make my head my home







The sons of bitches

Try to take my head







Tried to make me

Someone else instead







You've been in the band for five

minutes, and you're an icon?







It's such an honour,

and, you know, I'm stoked. So...







Your voting interest will equal

your percentage interest







in a new account,

while each of our voting interests







will be one-third of the difference







between     percent

and your percentage.







This is about as lawyer as you get.

But it's really--







- Sort of laying out--

- Yeah, lays out the deal.







Okay, so, for instance, in the first

period you have   percent, okay?







So when we do a vote, you

get    votes, you get    votes,







you get    votes, you get five votes,

in any vote, okay?







- But this doesn't mean anything.

- I think it's crap. I mean, l--







I think in the spirit

of what we're trying to do,







we better do    and then

Q Prime's the tiebreaker. That's--







That works, that's fine. Cool.







Now, here it also says, "You will not

be required to fund any losses







in the new Metallica account,

but we will be entitled







to recover any losses out

of future profits."







For instance, buying the documentary,

it's not your problem.







If the documentary loses money

and the company never makes







any more money again,

it's these three guys' problem.







Exactly.







"What'd you do with your money?"







"I went and bought a car,

I bought my mom a house,







and we went and bought

a documentary."







It was just-- You gotta keep

in the spirit of this whole thing.







By the end of this week,

we're gonna have an album title.







Because in three days, we won't

have to agonize about this anymore.







Well, the thing that stood out to me

was St. Anger. It's strong.







I mean, there's--

Iconic strong, you know?







- I like that title quite a bit.

- It's so easy







just to say,

"June   th is St. Anger's Day."







- Yeah, well, it's true. That's cool.

- No, I mean--







I think Frantic is a better album title.







- I think that's--

- I don't know.







- It's more about the record.

- But St. Anger's a good--







It's an original statement.

St. Anger, St. Anger.







Well, this is an angry record,







but you read the lyrics,

it's angry in a healthy way.







- It's also frantic.

- Getting stuff out.







Frantic is more like,

"They're trying things that they don't--







They don't--

They're not exactly sure of.







They don't know what they're doing.







They're trying to climb back up

the mountain again.







They're not sure of themselves."







I mean, hello, that's a fair thing.







I mean, if you think that Frantic

has a negative connotation to it,







I never thought of it like that.







If it's St. Anger,

they're gonna form an image of:







"These guys are angry. I know it.







They're angry about Napster.

They're angry about the new stuff







that's coming in.

They're angry about their lives.







I'm angry too. I get it."







I think you guys know the idea about

shooting a video in San Quentin.







So let me get this straight.







You're gonna go to

a maximum-security prison,







and Metallica's gonna play

"St. Anger" really loud.







- Yeah!

- Yeah!







St. Anger 'round my neck







St. Anger 'round my neck







He never gets respect







St. Anger 'round my neck







I've been asked to come out here

and talk a little bit







about what this song means to us.







Anger's an emotion that I've struggled

with for pretty much all my life.







- St. Anger 'round my neck

- You flush it out, you flush it out







He never gets respect







There's a lot of misspent anger







that has come out sideways

for a lot of people.







Including yourselves.







And if I hadn't had music in my life,







it's quite possible I could be in here,

or not even in here, be dead.







And I'd much rather be alive.







Madly in anger with you







I'm madly in anger with you







I'm madly in anger with you







I'm madly in anger with you







I'm pretty nervous up here.

I don't really know what to say.







I'm just trying to share

some of what's going on for me.







I'm not here to sell nothing,

that's for damn sure.







Everyone is born good.







Everyone's got the same size soul,

and we're here to connect with that.







So we're very proud to be

in your house







and play some music for you.

Thanks.







More than any other record,

I don't know if you feel that,







but for me, this is like product







of what we're just doing, hanging out.

You know what I mean?







- It's almost like a diary.

- Yeah.







It's like, here's our memories on CD,

you know?







It's like we've proven that

you can make aggressive music







- without negative energy.

- Yeah.







Okay, and I don't think anybody ever

thought that that would be possible.







You know? You can make

something that's aggressive







and fucked up, okay?

With positive energy







- between the people creating it.

- Yeah.







It hit me, you know? This project's

coming to an end, and I don't know,







I think I'm kind of bummed

about that.







I'm kind of, just, kind of liking

the schedule that happens,







or the safeness in that.

Coming here, being able to talk.







Creating, you know?

And... I don't know.







I've been kind of coming down

from this for about the past month.







I mean, getting up at   in the morning,

and just pacing my apartment.







Just not really knowing

what the hell I'm doing either.







So I'm with you.







Like, I don't wanna let you go home.







I don't know.







I really appreciate that.

That's really nice of you to say.







I don't know, I can feel myself

kind of protecting myself







with some depression or something,

wanting to just kind of isolate.







And I don't wanna do that.







I wanna feel the sadness of--







I mean, I didn't feel depressed,

I felt sad.







And that's when I knew it was

something different than just me...







My old stuff, you know?







I mean, there is some of that, but...







Sadness and depression, I guess

I don't really know the difference.







And, Phil, all the stuff

that you've brought here to, like...







You've set out all the tools,

like, you know?







And you allowed us to build

what we've built, you know?







With guidance.







I really appreciate your bringing

this forward.







And there is a difference between

sadness and depression.







Clearly.







This is the hugest chapter in my life.







If I could have my wasted days back







Would I use them to get

Back on track?







Stand back. Stand back.

Keep away from the car.







- I love you.

- I love you too.







Can I find it inside

To deal with what I shouldn't know?







Could I have my wasted days back

Would I use them to get back on track?







You live it or lie it

You live it or lie it







You live it or lie it

You live it or lie it







My lifestyle determines my deathstyle







Determines my deathstyle







Keep searching

Keep on searching







This search goes on

On and on







Keep searching, keep on searching







This search goes on

On and on

I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it's complicated

You know I love it when the news is bad

I'm only happy when it rains

I've been a rambler, the light changes me

Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men on fire, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsEmbedHi Guy (”That Was Just Your Life” demo) Lyrics[Intro (Lars Ulrich)]
(One, two)

[Verse 1]
Like a siren in my head and there is no emergency
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
Like a hurt that keeps me focused though I think I've gone astray
Like a low-grade nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like a dream, a beautiful dream
Not worthy of so I deny
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never opened them so it passed you by
You close your eyes so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Oh, almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is it so hard
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

[Verse 2]
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a spring that cannot be in current till it's time to drink
Like a puzzle, with missing pieces, and the box is thrown away
Like a release from prison that you didn't know you're in
Like a fight to live the past, I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission, until the war will start again
[Pre-Chorus]
You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never opened them so it passed you by
You close your eyes so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is it so hard
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Yeah, ooh yeah

Oh yeah

[Guitar Solo: Hammett]

[Bridge]
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot, that it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze, that brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot, that it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze, that brings you straight down to your knees
Oh yeah

Yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is it so hard
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

That was just your lifeEmbedSeek and Destroy- Live Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We're looking for you
To start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new
You know it drives us insane

[Chorus]
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
[Verse 2]
There is no escape
And that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye
To the world you live in
You have always been taking
But now you're giving



[Chorus]
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

[Verse 3]
Our brains are on fire
With the feeling to kill
And it will not go away
Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
Cause you're the one we will find
[Chorus]
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroyEmbedBattery (Live with the SFSO) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak  are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing  power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot  stop the battery
Pounding  out aggression, turn into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Damn  right
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Crushing  all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turn into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Hell yeah
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Ooh, battery
Battery

[Post-Chorus]
Are you alive?
How does it feel to be alive?
Show me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turn into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Fuckin' A right!
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Ooh, battery
Battery
Battery
Battery
Ooh yeah

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your Master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your Master (Master)
Master Master
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream
Master Master
Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream
Master Master
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your Master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your Master (Master)

[Welcome Home (Sanitarium)]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me the fuck alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again
Reach motherfucker reach
[Master of Puppets (continued)]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will Help you die
I will run through you
Now I'll rule you, too
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your Master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your Master
Master Master
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream

We've got some friends out here that know some of the old shit, I hope, right?
We've come here to play a couple new ones, but we gotta play some old motherfuckin' shit
You ready?

So this one's a kind of a compilation of a couple things off the first couple albums
We hope you all got them out there
If not, you're a mother fucker!
Go, motherfucker

["Ride the Lightning"]
Good God!
Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die, ooh!
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
Yeah yeah yeah
Sho-!

No remorse for the helpless one
War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what -
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't give a shit what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Your hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees

Row after row
Stone without soul
Or sorrow

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore
Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Is that rain or are they tears
That stain this concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall

An heir of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel it'll down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?

Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
